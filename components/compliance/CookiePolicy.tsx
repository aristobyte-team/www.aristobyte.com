          In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or

        <p className="compliance__par">
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <p className="compliance__par">
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, AristoByte ) are
          called &quot;first-party cookies.&quot; Cookies set by parties other
          than the website owner are called &quot;third-party cookies.&quot;
          Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be
          provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
          content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party
          cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in
          question and also when it visits certain other websites.
        </p>
        <h2 className="compliance__title-small">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p className="compliance__par">
          We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
          cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to
          operate, and we refer to these as &quot;essential&quot; or
          &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable us
          to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
          experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
          through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
          This is described in more detail below.

        <h2 className="compliance__title-small">How can I control cookies?</h2>
        <p className="compliance__par">
          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
          can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
          Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to
          select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
          cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
          you with services.
        </p>
        <p className="compliance__par">
          The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and
          on our Website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
          Website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
          Website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser
          controls to accept or refuse cookies.

          What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
        </h2>
        <p className="compliance__par">
          Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
          website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time,
          like web beacons (sometimes called &quot;tracking pixels&quot; or
          &quot;clear gifs&quot;). These are tiny graphics files that contain a
          unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has
          visited our Website or opened an email including them. This allows us,
          for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
          within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies,
          to understand whether you have come to the website from an online
          advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
          performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.
          In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to
          function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their
          functioning.
